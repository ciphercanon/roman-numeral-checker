# roman-numeral-checker
on the tenth day of learning JavaScript via FreeCodeCamp

## Live Site
[See live on netlify] - https://roman-numeral-checker.netlify.app/

## Features



## Built With
HTML - basic to prepare for the dark mode and light mode and also added my github.
CSS - alot of the code having to do with changing the color and i used root so i can understand it more.
Javascript - this was weird since what i did was have multiple function call each other with each checking for which event for the numeral number.

## Attempt
time = aproximently 8 hour~.
ideas = this one was less planned on the desing as you can see by the game but it was mainly plan to test making a dark mode and light mode.

## Extra Comment By Me
for nearly all of these javascript project i did not use media query except for some of them and this is because i did not understand much of it even after the html and css courses, but only
after i found the importance did i use it and in all these javascript project i try to use most of what i learn of html and css and even those i dont understand from the courses so that i could understand them more.
