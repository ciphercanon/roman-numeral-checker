on the tenth day of learning JavaScript via FreeCodeCamp

## Live Site
[See live on netlify] - https://roman-numeral-checker.netlify.app/

## Features
nicer mobile availbilty but lacking in horzontal usage
a covert button to convert input into numeral number via showing the answer in the output
a shrinking button the can shrink and revert back to the orgininal states
a light and dark mode option
my github.


## Built With
HTML - basic to prepare for the dark mode and light mode and also added my github.
CSS - alot of the code having to do with changing the color and i used root so i can understand it more.
Javascript - this was weird since what i did was have multiple function call each other with each checking for which event for the numeral number.

## Attempt
time = aproximently 8 hour~.
ideas = this one was less planned on the desing as you can see by the game but it was mainly plan to test making a dark mode and light mode.

## Extra Comment By Me
I actually love the feature on this one since the dark and light mode was nice and also i try using fonts picture to make it look nicer, this one took a long time due to me trying to study numeral number and also applying the function to convert. I also notice that because of me putting the overflow hidden it got rid of the y scroll which led to a struggle for if you trying to use it while having the phone flip.
